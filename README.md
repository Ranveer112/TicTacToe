# TicTacToe
This is an implementation of the multiplayer version of the famous game of TicTacToe. 

At the start, the board starts with character ```'e'``` denoting empty boxes
```
   e e e
   e e e
   e e e
```
And a message on the console asking for the player 1 input

```
   What is Player 1 move?
```
Player 1 is expected to enter ```x,y``` input with no spaces where x and y are of datatype ```int```. Failure to do so leads to an exception. 
```0,0``` denotes the uppermost left corner of the board.
